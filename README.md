# IoT Weather Reporting System

## Description

This system retrieves real-time weather data from a Raspberry Pi via RESTful web services and showcases it to users, serving as a platform for convenient access to weather information. The application leverages eight well-established design patterns in Java to ensure robustness, scalability, and maintainability.
