# IoT Weather Reporting System

## Description

This system retrieves real-time weather data from a Raspberry Pi via RESTful web services and showcases it to users, serving as a platform for convenient access to weather information. The application leverages eight well-established design patterns in Java to ensure robustness, scalability, and maintainability.

## Technologies

- Java: Implemented core application logic, including data retrieval, processing, and presentation. Leveraged Java's object-oriented features for modular design and scalability.
- MySQL: Utilized as the primary database management system for storing weather data retrieved from the Raspberry Pi. Designed database schema, implemented CRUD operations, and ensured data integrity.
- JBoss EAP: Deployed the Java application on the JBoss Enterprise Application Platform for robustness and scalability. Leveraged JBoss features for managing resources, deploying applications, and ensuring high availability.
- Red Hat Developer Studio: Employed as the integrated development environment (IDE) for Java development, providing tools for code editing, debugging, and project management.
- Apache Tomcat: Hosted the Java web application, serving HTTP requests and managing servlets. Configured Tomcat for optimal performance and scalability, ensuring seamless user experience.
- JAX-RS: Implemented RESTful web services for communication between the front-end and back-end components of the application. Defined endpoints for retrieving weather data and supported various HTTP methods for data manipulation.
- XHTML: Used for structuring web pages and defining their content. Utilized XHTML tags to create a well-defined document structure, ensuring compatibility with different web browsers and devices.
- CSS: Styled the user interface by applying CSS rules to HTML elements. Defined styles for fonts, colors, layouts, and responsiveness, enhancing the visual appeal and usability of the application.
- jQuery: Enhanced user interaction and dynamic content manipulation on the client side. Leveraged jQuery for DOM traversal, event handling, and AJAX requests, improving the responsiveness and interactivity of the application.
- JavaScript: Implemented client-side scripting for enhancing user experience and interactivity. Used JavaScript to handle form validation, perform calculations, and manipulate page elements dynamically.
- Bootstrap: Utilized the Bootstrap framework for developing responsive and mobile-first web pages. Leveraged Bootstrap components and utilities for layout, navigation, forms, and other UI elements, ensuring consistent appearance across devices.
- Raspberry Pi: Integrated as the source of real-time weather data generation. Programmed the Raspberry Pi using Python to collect weather information from sensors and expose it via RESTful APIs.
- Python: Developed scripts on the Raspberry Pi for gathering weather data from sensors and exposing it via RESTful web services. Utilized Python's simplicity and versatility for rapid development and seamless integration with hardware components.
