# IoT Weather Reporting Application

## Description

IoT weather reporting application, developed using Enterprise Java technologies, retrieves and showcases weather data sourced from a Raspberry Pi via RESTful web services implemented with JAX-RS. The architecture of the application leverages eight well-established design patterns in Java.
